elections for other qualifying events will be subject to drb approval since there is no information to match against.

elections for the events bert knows about will be automatically approved once they come in from iris. they will be matched on the following criteria:

- bargaining unit - exact match

- health eligibility indicator - must always be y
- event date - within the system set range (e.g. +/- 5 days)

if the election event date is off by more than the system set range, then drb staff approval is required. if the bargainunit or full/part time indicator does not match, it will be ignored/rejected.">

===
the currently published rules on drb website seem to contradict the current coverage rules in sims. we need to clarify those rules for the bert design. we are specifically concerned with the **bold** below language:

updated rule, effective january 1, 2020:
===
alaskacare eligible employees in lwop status on the first working day of the month will continue their health insurance coverage if they continue to timely pay their monthly insurance premium (through payroll deduction **or self-pay**). the employee will no longer be required to be in pay status for four hours on the first workday of the month.

**it is the employee’s responsibility to ensure the alaskacare premium is paid in order to remain covered. this may require action on the employee’s part as the alaskacare premium may not automatically be deducted from an employee’s paycheck when the employee is in lwop status.**

note: **leave of absence rules, such as seasonal leave of absence (slwop) remain the same and will still result in periods without coverage.**

note that this change also matches the interpretation of service events (stand and end dates are *inclusive* -- i.e., the termination date/end date for service is the last day at work and not the first day not at work).  this also align with how the lwop segment appears in iris -- there is a start date and end date and then the next record shows the "return to work" event starting on the day following the lwop end date.

the new interface view from employer services (empsrv.bert_employment_event, which is represented in bert by the synonym es_employment_event) will be written to reflect this, and so the end_date field for the core bert table employment_event should also be interpreted to be the last day of the period for all employment event types.">

      <div class="rule-card page-break-after" data-search="coverage begins ## new employees

**full-time:**

coverage begins on 31st consecutive day that employee is in pay status, provided no lwop. employee must elect to waive coverage.

in event of lwop, coverage begins on 31st consecutive day that employee is in pay status from end date of lwop.

_alaskacare booklet states: "...in no event will your waiting period be longer than 90 calendar days, if you are at work and in pay status on such date." is that regardless of length of lwop during first 90 days?_

a: 90 regardless of lwop status

**part-time:**

provided employee has enrolled in coverage during first 30 days of employment, coverage begins on 31st consecutive day that employee is in pay status.

_what about lwop_?

## term/rehire

if you are are rehired within 7 days from end date of coverage, your coverage resumes the day you return to work. if not, you follow the new employee process.

notes from 8/6 requirements meeting:

term/rehire

- generally, a termination followed by a rehire triggers the 31-day waiting period again
- _exception_: if a member is terminated and then rehired in benefits-eligible position 7 calendar days or fewer from the end of coverage in prior position, then coverage resumes **immediately** upon rehire (no waiting period)
  - **example 1**: member has health coverage, terminates on 8/7/2020. member is rehired on 9/7/2020. coverage ended on 8/31/2020, so the rehire is within the 7-day window and coverage starts immediately on 9/7/2020.
  - **example 2**: same facts as example 1, except that the rehire date is 9/8/2020 instead. now, member is outside the 7-day window, so must go through waiting period again. coverage in new position will start on 10/08/2020 (assuming member is continually in pay status during waiting period).
- this only applies to actual service terminations / separation events. for example, it does not apply to layoff, which operates the same as a normal lwop/loa event

## from non-participating bu to participating bu

coverage begins on first day of month after date of bargaining unit change unless employee elects to waive coverage. if change date is first of month, new coverage is effective that same day.

_first business day or calendar day?_

## dependents

coverage of eligible dependents begins the same day that your coverage begins, provided that you have enrolled them and updated your elections to family coverage within the first 30 days of employment.

newborns are automatically covered for the first 31 days after birth. after 31 days, must be enrolled according to status change rules

## surviving dependents of peace officers and firefighters

coverage begins the first day of the month following acknowledgement from department of public safety that surviving dependent is eligible.

the following is a list of the other transaction types.

- employee/employer direct payments - these are either payments to the state by the employee (usually by a check) or payments made via a transfer of funds in the state accounting system in a transaction outside payroll. this is a credit on the account.
- employee/employer direct refunds - these are either refunds of credit balance made to the employee from the state accounting system or refunds made via a transfer of funds in the state accounting system in a transaction outside payroll. this is a charge on the account.
- write-off - this transaction simply writes-off an open amount for the employee or employer. these can be either positive or negative amounts. this is a credit on the account if positive, otherwise a charge on the account.

      <div class="rule-card page-break-after" data-search="employee ui elections after oe # background

the time between the closing of open enrollment and the end of the calendar year (year end period) will need special handling for the employee ui. this is because there are two coverage periods in play: the current benefit year and next benefit year. the system needs to provide a way for the employee to make choices for both periods. normally, after open enrollment closes, that option is no longer available to employees.

we also need to consider the case of a new employee who does not yet have their account fully activated. currently the system only allows the employee to select their hire event coverage choice.

currently, the employee would need to contact drb to have the change made on their behalf.

the administrative ui does not have this problem in that there are no restrictions imposed on the change reason for the staff (i.e. open enrollment option is always available).

there are two new features that could provide a solution.

# auto open enrollment coverage choice created

with this feature, when an active employee makes a coverage change during the year end period, at the final screen where they review and submit their election, an additional checkbox will appear (already checked) titled “also apply these choices to next benefit year (2025)”.

when a new employee makes a new hire choice, the system will not show the checkbox, but will just behave like it is checked. this is because the new employee does not currently have any other change types provided.

when this box is checked, the backend should create save the current choice for the current event and create an open enrollment choice for the new benefit year. the creation of the oe coverage choice should probably should be done using a stored procedure because there may be complex logic involved if there are any plan differences between the current and next benefit year. there may also be differences in hfsa maximums (the smaller amount should apply).

# allow open enrollment if year end period coverage choice exists.

with this feature, the back end will include the open enrollment change reason in the list of options if there is a coverage choice that starts within the year end period (may be earlier than the oe closing date?).">

      <div class="rule-card page-break-after" data-search="subscriber coverage tab # overview

the subscriber - coverage form provides a way to view and modify coverage.

# user interface

the following is a draft of the user interface for the subscriber coverage tab.

![coveragetab.drawio.png](https://trello.com/1/cards/66019eae095e764f85215e86/attachments/66a2bc7eed31103d20543829/download/coveragetab.drawio.png)

# use cases

the following are the use cases for the coverage tab:

![use\_cases.drawio.png](https://trello.com/1/cards/66019eae095e764f85215e86/attachments/661048a1d6234609c1577d6b/download/use_cases.drawio.png)

## view list of coverages

when the coverage tab is initially displayed for a subscriber/employee it will provide a list of coverage and coverage choices in date order.

the following are the columns displayed in the **coverage** list:

- coverage id - the system assigned id for this coverage (needed?)
- start date - the starting date for this coverage
- end date - the ending date for this coverage
- status - the status for this coverage: active, awaiting admin approval, pending employment data, rejected, deleted, duplicate, replaced. note: the logic for deriving the values for display in the backend is specified on the following card: [https://trello.com/c/cgatehuy](https://trello.com/c/cgatehuy "smartcard-inline")
- source - indicates the source of this coverage including:
  - coverage choice + coverage choice source
  - default coverage
  - continuation of prior coverage (when no change of status)
  - carryover of prior coverage for new benefit year
  - conversion of prior coverage (when there is a change of status)
    - note: the logic for deriving the values for display in the backend is specified on the following card: [https://trello.com/c/cgatehuy](https://trello.com/c/cgatehuy "smartcard-inline")
- row color - normal-active, yellow - pending, red-past due?

the list will represent the two types of items in the following ways:

- if the item is a coverage that was generated by an employment event alone (without a coverage choice), then the source will display the coverage source title. this case arises when an employment event comes through the payroll system, but the employee has not made a coverage choice for that event. the system creates this coverage based on rules (e.g. default coverages, continuation of coverage or benefit year carryover). the item’s status will show “active”.
- if the item is a coverage that was governed by a choice, the source will display “coverage choice” plus the coverage choice source (e.g. subscriber). this case arises when a choice is made that either 1) is correctly associated with an employment event, or 2) is from a qualifying event not associated with an employment event, or 3) is associated with a qualifying employment event that bert does not track. the item’s status will show “active”.
- if the item is a pending coverage choice, the source will display “coverage choice - subscriber” and the status will show one of the following:
  - pending approval for items that need drb staff approval
  - pending personnel change for items that are waiting for a matching employment event or status change to appear in the payroll interface. a pending coverage is not an active coverage at this stage. it’s coverage start date will intersect another active coverage period. when the choice is approved or the payroll event comes through the interface, a new coverage period will be created that replaces or splits a prior coverage period. if an item remain pending for too long, it will be highlighted as needing attention from drb staff.
  - rejected, deleted, replaced or duplicate. these types only show up if the user has checked the include inactive coverage checkbox.

## toggle include inactive coverage choices

above the coverage list there is a checkbox titled **include inactive coverage.** this will control whether the list contains only active coverage items (i.e. not rejected, replaced, deleted or duplicate).

## buttons for coverage list

the following buttons appear below the coverage list:

- new coverage choice - this will allow the staff to create a new coverage choice for the subscriber. the new coverage choice button will open the coverage choice form. no information will be populated. the staff will need to fill out all the required information.
- regenerate coverage - this will allow the staff to regenerate the coverage for the subscriber over a period of time provided by the staff. it will do this based on current employment information and any coverage choices.
- show/hide details - this will show or hide the additional details for a selected coverage row.

## view details and list of benefits for selected coverage

when the staff clicks on a coverage row in the list, the system will display information on the right hand side of the tab. this will be a list of coverage benefits including costs.

the **coverage benefits** table displays the following columns for the selected **coverage**:

- benefit type - the type: medical, dental, vision, hfsa
- benefit plan - the selected benefit plan for this coverage
- benefit level - the selected benefit level for this coverage
- ee monthly amount - the monthly employee cost for this coverage
- er monthly amount - the monthly employer cost for this coverage
- opt-out date/time - if the employee opted out, this field will contain the date/time of that choice.

on the bottom right hand side of the coverage tab, buttons will appear for the selected coverage row. these are actions that can be applied to the currently selected coverage. the buttons will be enabled based on the current status of the selected coverage row.

- modify - always enabled
- approve(un-approve) - if the coverage choice current status is awaiting staff approval (or un-approve if already approved)
- reject(un-reject) - if the coverage choice current status is awaiting staff approval. (or un-reject if the choice has been rejected)
- delete(un-delete) - if the coverage choice current status is not deleted (or un-delete if the coverage choice is deleted)

### coverage details

if the staff has pressed the show details button, then the following additional information will be displayed on the tab.

![coveragetab-details.drawio.png](https://trello.com/1/cards/66019eae095e764f85215e86/attachments/66a2bc46c11ded6f8659730c/download/coveragetab-details.drawio.png)

coverage information displayed in this area will include:

- coverage change reason
- event date
- hins z indicator
- coverage source
- part/full time indicator
- health eligibility indicator
- bargaining unit
- benefit package name

coverage choice information (if applicable) in this area will include:

- created date
- created by
- actual event date
- received date
- approved date
- approved by
- employment status match date
- staff notes

## regenerate coverage dialog

![regenerate\_coverage\_dialog.drawio.png](https://trello.com/1/cards/66019eae095e764f85215e86/attachments/66a2b6653d7a54f5a9200c1c/download/regenerate_coverage_dialog.drawio.png)

the following are the fields on this dialog:

- lookback start date - the earliest benefit year to scan for changes in coverage. always jan 1st.
- change start date: the first date to start making coverage changes.
- move coverage start date checkbox. see below for details.

if this subscriber has employment information, then this button will be enabled. this button (unchecked by default) will regenerate the coverage for an employee based on their employment information and coverage choices.

the regeneration process will look look and employment information and coverage choices starting with the **lookback start date** through today. the default lookback start date is set to the beginning of the prior year. based on that information it will reconstruct their coverage based on business rules. this date can be changed but it must always be january 1st of a year.

if any coverage changes are detected prior to the **change start date** and the box is unchecked, no changes will be made a dashboard item will be created. if the box is checked and a change is detected that starts prior to the **change start date**, then any coverage prior to that date will be left as-is and new coverage will be created starting on the **change start date**.

## modify coverage choice

when the staff clicks the modify button or double-clicks the row, the coverage choice form will open. this form is used to modify a coverage choice.

## approve coverage choice

if the current status of the coverage choice was awaiting staff approval then the approve button will be enabled. if the staff presses this button a dialog will appear to allow entry of staff notes with continue and cancel buttons. if the staff selects continue, the existing coverage choice status will be changed to approved and the approved by and approved date/time will be updated by the system. calls dialog with coverage choice id.

## un-approval of coverage choice

if the current status of the coverage choice was approved then this button will be enabled. if the staff presses this button a dialog will appear to allow entry of staff notes with continue and cancel buttons. if the staff selects continue, the existing coverage choice status will be changed to awaiting staff approval and the approved by and approved date/time will be cleared by the system. calls dialog with coverage choice id.

## reject coverage choice

if the current status of the coverage choice was awaiting staff approval then the reject button will be enabled. if the staff presses this button a dialog will appear to allow entry of staff notes with continue and cancel buttons. if the staff selects continue, the existing coverage choice status will be changed to rejected and the approved by and approved date/time will be cleared by the system.

## un-reject coverage choice

if the current status of the coverage choice was rejected then this button will be enabled. if the staff presses this button a dialog will appear to allow entry of staff notes with continue and cancel buttons. if the staff selects continue, the existing coverage choice status will be changed to awaiting staff approval and the approved by and approved date/time will be cleared by the system.

## delete coverage choice

if the current status of the coverage choice is not deleted then this button will be enabled. if the staff presses this button a dialog will appear to allow entry of staff notes with continue and cancel buttons. if the staff selects continue, the existing coverage choice status will be changed to deleted and the approved by and approved date/time will be cleared by the system. calls dialog with coverage choice id.

## undelete coverage choice

if the current status of the coverage choice is deleted then this button will be enabled. if the staff presses this button a dialog will appear to allow entry of staff notes with continue and cancel buttons. if the staff selects continue, the existing coverage choice status will be changed to either awaiting staff approval or staff approval not needed (depending on the coverage change reason) and the approved by and approved date/time will be cleared by the system. calls dialog with coverage choice id.">

This case arises when a choice is made that either 1) is correctly associated with an employment event, or 2) is from a qualifying event not associated with an employment event, or 3) is associated with a qualifying employment event that BERT does not track. The item’s status will show “Active”.<br>- If the item is a pending coverage choice, the Source will display “Coverage Choice - Subscriber” and the Status will show one of the following:<br>  - Pending Approval for items that need DRB Staff approval<br>  - Pending Personnel Change for items that are waiting for a matching employment event or status change to appear in the payroll interface. A pending coverage is not an active coverage at this stage. It’s coverage start date will intersect another active coverage period. When the choice is approved or the payroll event comes through the interface, a new coverage period will be created that replaces or splits a prior coverage period. If an item remain pending for too long, it will be highlighted as needing attention from DRB staff.<br>  - Rejected, Deleted, Replaced or Duplicate. These types only show up if the user has checked the Include Inactive Coverage checkbox.</p><h2>Toggle Include Inactive Coverage Choices</h2><p>Above the Coverage list there is a checkbox titled <strong>Include Inactive Coverage.</strong> This will control whether the list contains only active coverage items (i.e. not Rejected, Replaced, Deleted or Duplicate).</p><h2>Buttons for Coverage List</h2><p>The following buttons appear below the coverage list:</p><p>- New Coverage Choice - This will allow the staff to create a new coverage choice for the subscriber. The New Coverage Choice button will open the Coverage Choice form. No information will be populated. The staff will need to fill out all the required information.<br>- Regenerate Coverage - This will allow the staff to regenerate the coverage for the subscriber over a period of time provided by the staff. It will do this based on current employment information and any coverage choices.<br>- Show/Hide Details - This will show or hide the additional details for a selected coverage row.</p><h2>View Details and List of Benefits for Selected Coverage</h2><p>When the staff clicks on a coverage row in the list, the system will display information on the right hand side of the tab. This will be a list of Coverage Benefits including costs.</p><p>The <strong>Coverage Benefits</strong> table displays the following columns for the selected <strong>Coverage</strong>:</p><p>- Benefit Type - The type: Medical, Dental, Vision, HFSA<br>- Benefit Plan - The selected benefit plan for this coverage<br>- Benefit Level - The selected benefit level for this coverage<br>- EE Monthly Amount - The monthly employee cost for this coverage<br>- ER Monthly Amount - The monthly employer cost for this coverage<br>- Opt-Out Date/Time - If the employee opted out, this field will contain the date/time of that choice.</p><p>On the bottom right hand side of the Coverage Tab, buttons will appear for the selected Coverage row. These are actions that can be applied to the currently selected Coverage. The buttons will be enabled based on the current status of the selected Coverage row.</p><p>- Modify - always enabled<br>- Approve(Un-approve) - If the coverage choice current status is Awaiting Staff Approval (or Un-approve if already approved)<br>- Reject(Un-reject) - If the coverage choice current status is Awaiting Staff Approval.

      <div class="rule-card page-break-after" data-search="benefit defaults & conversions & carryover ## overview

in cases where an employee has not made election choices, a set of tables and a hfsa rule will be used for determining what the election benefit choices will be when creating new elections. the tables will provide data for defaults, conversion and carryover. the default process for creating election benefits is to copy the benefit option these tables will only contain exceptions and will be scoped by date. so the copy logic will be: if no entry in conversion/carry over tables for election benefit month start date, then copy as-is.

## new eligibility

when an employee is eligible for benefits, but does not make elections, the system will select a default set of elections. these defaults will be time sensitive (see table benefit\_package\_default).

## change benefit package

when an employee changes bargaining unit and does not make elections and if the benefit package differs between bargaining units, the system will use conversion data to setup the new election benefits. this conversion data will be time sensitive. if no translation record is found, the benefit\_options will be copied as is (see table benefit\_package_convert).

## open enrollment

after open enrollment is over, new elections will be created for employees who did not make elections for the new benefit year. this carryover data is time sensitive. if no carryover data is found for a benefit, it will be setup the same as the prior benefit  year (see table benefit\_package\_carryover).

## health flexible spending account (hfsa) rule

currently hfsa elections are not automatically carried over during open enrollment. an employee must make a hfsa election for the new benefit year. when doing a default operation, the hfsa will be 0. when doing a convert, the hfsa will be whatever the prior election within the same benefit year.">

      <div class="rule-card page-break-after" data-search="regenerate coverage old design # old version

the process will scan for following sources that could trigger coverage changes:

- employment events - hire/rehire
- employment status - bargaining unit change, health status change and part/full time change.
- other qualifying event - coverage choice for non-employment driven type changes. found by scanning coverage choice for specific event types. staff must approve if required otherwise choice is ignored.
- open enrollment - for elections starting on january 1st, it will look for open enrollment choices
- return from leave of absence ? we may defer to staff.
- termination - will set the election end_date

definition of special term/function: firstfirst. for a given date, if it falls on the 1st, then use that date, else use 1st of following month.

in searching for election choices, the following are assumptions about the dates:

- event date - date of qualifying event
- received date - date election made/received
- start date - is usually set to the firstfirst of event date, except in cases of the rehire 7 day rule.

### working set of employees

the parent process will identify the set of employees to work on. further, there may be a scoping date for each employee which will limit the date range for events, status, elections and choices included. the scoping date will be backstopped by a control date limiting how far back we will regenerate elections for any employee.

### old sbs hire/rehire process (reference only)

in a hire, sbs used the following rule for linking a orphan election choice to a hire event:

```
if the hire dates do not match between the employer supplied
date and the employee supplied date, use the employer
date and log an event if it's in the same benefit month.
if the given date isn't even in the same benefit month, use
the given date as it's unknown what this orphan txn is for.
```

in a rehire, sbs used the following rule for linking a pending election choice to a rehire event:

```
if the hire date in employment doesn't match the pending
election transaction's event date, then see if the pending
txn's start date matches the calculated effective date.  if
that matches, we'll go ahead and process the pending txn
after we update the event date on it, as it must match the
hire date to process correctly. otherwise, we can't use this
pending transaction and need to log an event that the pending
couldn't be activated as the dates were too far off.
```

### hire/rehire

a new election will be created in all cases for a new hire or rehire.

for the working set of employees, fetch hire/rehire events on or after the scoping date. for each hire event, fetch the effective employment status and determine their rehire 7 day rule status. create a draft election based with the following fields populated upon creation:

- benefit\_package\_id will be based on their employment status
- full\_part\_time_indicator will be based on their employment status
- election\_reason\_id - new hire
- event_date - hire date
- election_date - hire date
- election_by - new hire processing
- election\_source\_id - default
- staff_notes - null
- start_date will be first first of hire date unless rehire 7 day rule applies in which case it will be the 1st of the month of the hire date
- coverage\_start\_date will be the hire date unless rehire 7 day rule applies in which case it will be the 1st of the month of the hire date
- election\_choice\_id - null

next try to find an election choice where:

- choice election reason is hire/rehire
- event(hire) date in election choice is in same month as employment event hire date
- election choice benefit package is same as derived from employment status

if found then update the draft election’s fields from election choice:

- election\_source\_id
- election_date
- election_by
- staff_notes
- election\_choice\_id
- start\_date if override\_start_date given
- coverage\_start\_date if override\_coverage\_start_date given

(note: coverage gaps will take care of when coverage actually starts for things such as waiting period).

### status change

a new election will only be created if an election choice exists or there is a change in benefit package or part/full time status.

status change event occurs when the current status differs from the prior status in either the benefit package or part/full time status.

for the working set of employees, fetch status change events on or after the scoping date. for a given status change, create a draft election based on the employment status information with the following fields populated upon creation:

- benefit\_package\_id will be based on their employment status
- full\_part\_time_indicator will be based on their employment status
- election\_reason\_id - status change
- event_date - status change date
- election_date - status change date
- election\_source\_id - default
- staff_notes - null
- start_date will be first first of status change date
- coverage\_start\_date - if moving from union coverage to ak care: if union was not in wait period, set coverage start date to first first of status change date else set to status change date, otherwise set it the same as the status change date
- election\_choice\_id - null

next try to find an election choice where:

- choice election reason is status change
- event(status change) date in election choice is in same benefit month as employment status change
- election choice benefit package is same as derived from employment status

if found then update the draft election’s fields from election choice:

- election\_source\_id
- election_date
- election_by
- staff_notes
- election\_choice\_id
- start\_date if override\_start_date given
- coverage\_start\_date if override\_coverage\_start_date given

### personal qualifying event

a qualifying event is detected from election choice data since there is no actual employment based event or change.

for the working set of employees, fetch personal qualifying event type election choices on or after the scoping date and where the benefit package for the corresponding employment status matches the election choice’s benefit package.

for the above results set, create a draft election based on the employment status and the election choice with the following fields populated upon creation:

- benefit\_package\_id will be based on their employment status
- full\_part\_time_indicator will be based on their employment status
- election\_reason\_id - from election choice
- event_date - from election choice
- election_date - from election choice
- election by - from election choice
- election\_source\_id - from election choice
- staff_notes - from election choice
- start\_date - from election choice override\_start_date unless it is null, otherwise use the first first of the event date
- coverage\_start\_date - from election choice override\_coverage\_start_date unless it is null, otherwise use the event date
- election\_choice\_id - from election choice

### open enrollment

the open enrollment processing generates elections for the new benefit year. when processing employees, a set of draft elections will be created for all 1/1/xx on or after the given date for those employees who are active(employed) as of 1/1/xx.

for each of those employees for each year, fetch their employment status and create a draft elections the following fields populated upon creation:

- benefit\_package\_id will be based on their employment status
- full\_part\_time_indicator will be based on their employment status
- election\_reason\_id - open enrollment
- event_date - 1/1/xx
- election_date - 1/1/xx
- election\_source\_id - default
- staff_notes - null
- start_date will be 1/1/xx
- coverage\_start\_date will be 1/1/xx
- election\_choice\_id - null

next try to find an election choice where the start\_date, benefit\_package\_id and election\_reason_id matches. if found then update the draft election’s fields:

- election\_source\_id
- election_date
- staff_notes
- election\_choice\_id

### return from leave of absence

new elections for return from leave of absence are only generated if there is an election choice, otherwise no election change occurs.

for the working set of employees, fetch return to work events on or after the scoping date and join employment status as of the event date and join an election choice for where benefit month and benefit package matches. for each event/choice, create a draft election with the following fields populated upon creation:

- benefit\_package\_id - from election choice
- full\_part\_time_indicator will be based on their employment status
- election\_reason\_id - from election choice
- event_date - from employment event
- election_date - from election choice
- election\_source\_id - from election choice
- staff_notes - from election choice
- start\_date - from election choice override\_start_date unless it is null, otherwise use the first first of the event date
- coverage\_start\_date -  from election choice override\_coverage\_start_date unless it is null, otherwise use the event date
- election\_choice\_id - from election choice

### termination

for the working set of employees, fetch termination events on or after the scoping date.

for each event, locate an election where the termination date is between the start date and end date (or 9999-12-31 if null). update the end date to the last day of the month of the termination date.

## create replacement election benefits

prior election is where the end date is day before current start date. it will be fetched from either draft elections if in prior election date is in scope otherwise from elections.

for each draft election create election benefits using the following logic:

- if the election\_choice\_id is not null, copy the benefits from election choice benefits.
- if the benefit package is 100, then do nothing. there are no benefits.
- for hire/rehire and rehire 7 day rule is false - create default benefits
- for hire/rehire and rehire 7 day rule is true and same prior election benefit package - copy benefits from prior election
- for hire/rehire and rehire 7 day rule is true and not same prior election benefit package - convert benefits from prior election
- for employment status change and same prior election benefit package - copy benefits from prior election
- for employment status change and not same prior election benefit package - convert benefits from prior election
- for personal qualifying event - (already taken care of 1st rule from above)
- for open enrollment and same prior election benefit package - carryover benefits from prior election and kill hfsa
- for open enrollment and not same prior election benefit package - convert benefits from prior election and kill hfsa

the following are details about the 3 processes used above:

- copy process - benefits are copied from a prior election or election choice as-is
- default process - benefits are derived from the benefit package default table for the given benefit package and date
- convert process - benefits are derived from a copy or prior benefits unless found in the benefit package convert table for the old/new benefit package, old benefit option id and date
- carryover process - benefits are derived from a copy or prior benefits unless found in the benefit package convert table for the old/new benefit package, old benefit option id and date.

## identify changed elections to add/remove/replace

after all draft elections and draft election benefits have been created, the draft elections and draft election benefits will be compared to the active elections and election benefits to detect additions, replacements and removals. this status will be recorded in the draft election table.

this process will then copy existing elections and election benefits to the discard election and discard election benefit tables that are marked for replacement or removal.

next this process will remove elections and election benefits that are marked for removal or replacement.

finally this process will copy draft elections and draft election benefits that are marked as additions or replacements.

## invoke downstream processes

after updating elections, the costs and adjustments will need to be regenerated.">

For each event/choice, create a Draft Election with the following fields populated upon creation:</p><p>- benefit\_package\_id - from Election Choice<br>- full\_part\_time_indicator will be based on their employment status<br>- election\_reason\_id - from Election Choice<br>- event_date - from Employment Event<br>- election_date - from Election Choice<br>- election\_source\_id - from Election Choice<br>- staff_notes - from Election Choice<br>- start\_date - from Election Choice override\_start_date unless it is null, otherwise use the First First of the event date<br>- coverage\_start\_date -  from Election Choice override\_coverage\_start_date unless it is null, otherwise use the event date<br>- election\_choice\_id - from Election Choice</p><h3>Termination</h3><p>For the working set of employees, fetch termination events on or after the scoping date.</p><p>For each event, locate an election where the termination date is between the start date and end date (or 9999-12-31 if null). Update the end date to the last day of the month of the termination date.</p><h2>Create Replacement Election Benefits</h2><p>Prior Election is where the end date is day before current start date. It will be fetched from either Draft Elections if in prior election date is in scope otherwise from Elections.</p><p>For each Draft Election create Election Benefits using the following logic:</p><p>- If the election\_choice\_id is not null, copy the benefits from Election Choice Benefits.<br>- If the benefit package is 100, then do nothing. There are no benefits.<br>- For Hire/Rehire and Rehire 7 Day Rule is false - create default benefits<br>- For Hire/rehire and Rehire 7 Day Rule is true and Same Prior Election Benefit Package - copy benefits from prior election<br>- For Hire/rehire and Rehire 7 Day Rule is true and Not Same Prior Election Benefit Package - convert benefits from prior election<br>- For Employment Status Change and Same Prior Election Benefit Package - copy benefits from prior election<br>- For Employment Status Change and Not Same Prior Election Benefit Package - convert benefits from prior election<br>- For Personal Qualifying Event - (already taken care of 1st rule from above)<br>- For Open Enrollment and Same Prior Election Benefit Package - carryover benefits from prior election and kill HFSA<br>- For Open Enrollment and Not Same Prior Election Benefit Package - convert benefits from prior election and kill HFSA</p><p>The following are details about the 3 processes used above:</p><p>- Copy process - benefits are copied from a prior election or election choice as-is<br>- Default process - benefits are derived from the Benefit Package Default table for the given benefit package and date<br>- Convert process - benefits are derived from a copy or prior benefits unless found in the Benefit Package Convert table for the old/new benefit package, old benefit option id and date<br>- Carryover process - benefits are derived from a copy or prior benefits unless found in the Benefit Package Convert table for the old/new benefit package, old benefit option id and date.</p><h2>Identify Changed Elections to Add/Remove/Replace</h2><p>After all Draft Elections and Draft Election Benefits have been created, the Draft Elections and Draft Election Benefits will be compared to the active Elections and Election Benefits to detect additions, replacements and removals. This status will be recorded in the Draft Election table.</p><p>This process will then copy existing Elections and Election Benefits to the Discard Election and Discard Election Benefit tables that are marked for replacement or removal.</p><p>Next this process will remove Elections and Election Benefits that are marked for removal or replacement.</p><p>Finally this process will copy Draft Elections and Draft Election Benefits that are marked as additions or replacements.</p><h2>Invoke Downstream Processes</h2><p>After updating elections, the costs and adjustments will need to be regenerated.</p>

possible issue: there may be some employment related events that we do not carry (i.e. change in pay, change in position, etc). generally the only status changes we are interested in are changes in the following 3 elements: bargaining\_unit, health\_eligible\_indicator and part\_full\_time\_indicator. we may need to skip verification of employment events that do not change those elements.

- start date (display only)
- original lwop type (display only)
- override lwop type (select fmla or mil)
- premium/coverage end date - fill with date coverage/premium payments end or leave blank if still paying. 

ui action overview
---
the purpose of this form is the following:

- change the classification of a regular lwop to fmla or mil
- change the payment status of a mil or fmla to indicate premium/coverage termination.
- save - create or update the record
- cancel - close form without saving changes

personnel event update process overview
---
when personnel event data is processed the following may occur:

- if an lwop return to work occurs, if there is a corresponding lwop override it will check the premium/coverage end date. if needed it will adjust that date (see rules).
- after employment events are updated, system will check to see if any lwop override records are orphaned. if so, it will delete that override and create a dashboard message indicating its removal along with its type, start date and cost coverage end date.

rules
---
- this process cannot be used to create a new fmla or mil, only to change an existing lwop.
- the coverage/premium ending date must always be a month end. the value cannot precede the starting date nor succeed the ending date of the lwop.
- when modifying a lwop override premium/coverage end date,  if it is beyond the return to work date, the end date will be adjusted to the month end prior to the return to work date. (need to edge test this rule language!!!!!)

sims data backport
---
the following will occur for certain bert actions:

- when new lwop override is created, the corresponding sims lwop type will be changed.
- when an lwop override is updated, the corresponding sims lwop type will be updated.">

contents
---
this form displays two tables. the first is the job history table that lists all the jobs in the schedule (past/present/future). it contains the following elements:

- job schedule id - id the for listed job
- status date - the date of the most recent status
- job title - the name of this job type
- job status - the current status of this job

the following are the job status types and their meaning:

- **ready** - indicates that job is in ready state and will be executed on or after its status date/time occurs.
- **running** - indicates that the job is currently running as of indicated status date/time.
- **completed** - indicates that the job has run and completed normally as of the indicated status date/time.
- **held** - indicates that there is a hold on this job as of the given status date/time. the job will not run until the user changes it the the **ready** state.
- **failed** - indicates that the job has run, but failed. the user must remedy the cause of the failure and change it to **ready** again so it will rerun. the user may also edit this job and change its start time and status to ready or held. the user may also choose to cancel this job and not rerun it. if this is normally a recurring type job, the user should schedule a future run of this job, otherwise it will never run again.
- **canceled** - indicated that the user has canceled this job and it will not be executed.

the second table is the schedule new job table. this lists all the types of jobs that can be scheduled. normally this list will be filtered to the types of jobs that an administrator would normally be responsible to schedule. if an administrator wanted to see all job types, they would check the "list all job types" checkbox. the following are the elements for this table:

- button - click this button to schedule a job. when clicked the schedule job dialog will open.
- description - this describes the job.

overview
===
this process will recalculate adjustment requests for a single or all employees. adjustment requests are based on existing costs and credits and future(issue date in future) certified, non-rejected adjustment requests. these requests are also based on anticipated contributions for upcoming payrolls of the current month.

)

process
---
for each employee and each benefit type the following process will be applied.

0. delete any adjustment requests that are not certified. also remove any certified adjustments for payroll that have already been processed (i.e. expired).
0. sum the net account balance for the benefit. this consists of the balance forward, plus all benefit costs and all contribution, payments and other transactions.
0. add in any certified adjustment requests in the adjustment queue.
0. add in any adjustments in es adjustment requests for payroll that have not yet been issued (i.e. associated payschedule.actualdate is null).
0. determine if there are any expected payroll contributions for the remainder of the month. if so, add those to the account balance.
0. if the balance is not zero, then create an adjustment request
0. set the pay schedule to the next upcoming payroll for the employee's pay group. leave it null if none are found ** or if the employee is terminated ?? **.
0. if the benefit is still active, set the effective date to the pay period ending date of the selected pay schedule. otherwise, find the most recent benefit month when the benefit was active and set the effective date to the 1st of that month. ** leave blank if employee is terminated?? **
