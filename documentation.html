===
the currently published rules on drb website seem to contradict the current coverage rules in sims. we need to clarify those rules for the bert design. we are specifically concerned with the **bold** below language:

updated rule, effective january 1, 2020:
===
alaskacare eligible employees in lwop status on the first working day of the month will continue their health insurance coverage if they continue to timely pay their monthly insurance premium (through payroll deduction **or self-pay**). the employee will no longer be required to be in pay status for four hours on the first workday of the month.

**it is the employee’s responsibility to ensure the alaskacare premium is paid in order to remain covered. this may require action on the employee’s part as the alaskacare premium may not automatically be deducted from an employee’s paycheck when the employee is in lwop status.**

note: **leave of absence rules, such as seasonal leave of absence (slwop) remain the same and will still result in periods without coverage.**

discussed in meeting with health team on 4/11/2022 -- decided to change this going forward in bert to align with business understanding of representing instead the last day on lwop.

note that this change also matches the interpretation of service events (stand and end dates are *inclusive* -- i.e., the termination date/end date for service is the last day at work and not the first day not at work).  this also align with how the lwop segment appears in iris -- there is a start date and end date and then the next record shows the "return to work" event starting on the day following the lwop end date.

the new interface view from employer services (empsrv.bert_employment_event, which is represented in bert by the synonym es_employment_event) will be written to reflect this, and so the end_date field for the core bert table employment_event should also be interpreted to be the last day of the period for all employment event types.">

            <p>For historical reasons, SIMS currently defines LWOP_END_DATE as the first day back at work (i.e., the first day *not* on LWOP).</p><p>Discussed in meeting with Health team on 4/11/2022 -- decided to change this going forward in BERT to align with business understanding of representing instead the last day on LWOP.</p><p>Note that this change also matches the interpretation of Service events (stand and end dates are *inclusive* -- i.e., the Termination Date/End Date for Service is the last day at work and not the first day not at work).  This also align with how the LWOP segment appears in IRIS -- there is a Start Date and End Date and then the next record shows the "Return to Work" event starting on the day following the LWOP End Date.</p><p>The new interface view from Employer Services (EMPSRV.BERT_EMPLOYMENT_EVENT, which is represented in BERT by the synonym ES_EMPLOYMENT_EVENT) will be written to reflect this, and so the END_DATE field for the core BERT table EMPLOYMENT_EVENT should also be interpreted to be the last day of the period for ALL Employment Event Types.</p>

Ronan has feedback on 1st of the month weekend/holiday question: Finance does look to the first business day when determining whether a person is active/benefits eligible (they do not disrupt coverage if a person was on leave on Jan 1, but has returned on the next business day) 

Decision: 1st business day of the month will be used by the system for the eligibility determination.  This could cause issues for members with unusual work schedules (e.g. members who are normally scheduled to work on weekends/holidays).  Andrea will discuss further with Finance, but since the number of cases with leave/1st of the month involving these people should be small, we could just rely on the SIMS/HI Code discrepancy detection to flag these cases and eligibility could be changed manually.</div>

        <div class="card-item" data-search="coverage begins ## new employees

**full-time:**

coverage begins on 31st consecutive day that employee is in pay status, provided no lwop. employee must elect to waive coverage.

in event of lwop, coverage begins on 31st consecutive day that employee is in pay status from end date of lwop.

_alaskacare booklet states: "...in no event will your waiting period be longer than 90 calendar days, if you are at work and in pay status on such date." is that regardless of length of lwop during first 90 days?_

a: 90 regardless of lwop status

**part-time:**

provided employee has enrolled in coverage during first 30 days of employment, coverage begins on 31st consecutive day that employee is in pay status.

_what about lwop_?

## term/rehire

if you are are rehired within 7 days from end date of coverage, your coverage resumes the day you return to work. if not, you follow the new employee process.

notes from 8/6 requirements meeting:

term/rehire

- generally, a termination followed by a rehire triggers the 31-day waiting period again
- _exception_: if a member is terminated and then rehired in benefits-eligible position 7 calendar days or fewer from the end of coverage in prior position, then coverage resumes **immediately** upon rehire (no waiting period)
  - **example 1**: member has health coverage, terminates on 8/7/2020. member is rehired on 9/7/2020. coverage ended on 8/31/2020, so the rehire is within the 7-day window and coverage starts immediately on 9/7/2020.
  - **example 2**: same facts as example 1, except that the rehire date is 9/8/2020 instead. now, member is outside the 7-day window, so must go through waiting period again. coverage in new position will start on 10/08/2020 (assuming member is continually in pay status during waiting period).
- this only applies to actual service terminations / separation events. for example, it does not apply to layoff, which operates the same as a normal lwop/loa event

## from non-participating bu to participating bu

coverage begins on first day of month after date of bargaining unit change unless employee elects to waive coverage. if change date is first of month, new coverage is effective that same day.

_first business day or calendar day?_

## dependents

coverage of eligible dependents begins the same day that your coverage begins, provided that you have enrolled them and updated your elections to family coverage within the first 30 days of employment.

newborns are automatically covered for the first 31 days after birth. after 31 days, must be enrolled according to status change rules

## surviving dependents of peace officers and firefighters

coverage begins the first day of the month following acknowledgement from department of public safety that surviving dependent is eligible.

the following is a list of the other transaction types.

- employee/employer direct payments - these are either payments to the state by the employee (usually by a check) or payments made via a transfer of funds in the state accounting system in a transaction outside payroll. this is a credit on the account.
- employee/employer direct refunds - these are either refunds of credit balance made to the employee from the state accounting system or refunds made via a transfer of funds in the state accounting system in a transaction outside payroll. this is a charge on the account.
- write-off - this transaction simply writes-off an open amount for the employee or employer. these can be either positive or negative amounts. this is a credit on the account if positive, otherwise a charge on the account.

·         generally, a termination followed by a rehire triggers the 31-day waiting period again

·         _exception_: if a member is terminated and then rehired in benefits-eligible position 7 calendar days or fewer from the end of coverage in prior position, then coverage resumes **immediately** upon rehire (no waiting period)

o   **example 1**: member has health coverage, terminates on 8/7/2020.  member is rehired on 9/7/2020.  coverage ended on 8/31/2020, so the rehire is within the 7-day window and coverage starts immediately on 9/7/2020.

o   **example 2**: same facts as example 1, except that the rehire date is 9/8/2020 instead.  now, member is outside the 7-day window, so must go through waiting period again.  coverage in new position will start on 10/08/2020 (assuming member is continually in pay status during waiting period).

this only applies to actual service terminations / separation events.  for example, it does not apply to layoff, which operates the same as a normal lwop/loa event">

these entities are the interface tables between employer services (es) and benefit eligibility reporting tracker (bert). they will be implemented in using the following strategies:

- view (v) - these entities will be available through a database view.
- table (t) - these entities will be available as database tables. this will allow for creating foreign key constraints from bert.

in es the database objects will be created using a name prefixed with "bert_" (e.g. bert_employer).a grant will be made to the bert user. in the bert schema a synonym will be created for the object using a name prefixed with "es_" (e.g. es_employer).

this interface entity will be implemented as a table which will be updated anytime the employer table is updated. no triggers will be implemented at this time to detect changes since the state of alaska (employer_id 9000) is the only participating employer for bert. if there are ever additional employers to be processed by this system, then triggers (or a similar mechanism) will be required.
